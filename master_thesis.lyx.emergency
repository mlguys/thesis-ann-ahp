Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) which also can be call as "Multiple
 Criteria Decision-Making" or "Multi-criteria Decision Aiding'' in English
 or "Analyse Multicrit√®re" in French is an exciting field which has seen
 many achievements including increasing number of research papers, books,
 and theoretical over the years since the 60s

\begin_layout Standard
For many decision makers, MCDA is an excellent tool in getting comprehensive
 insight information when solving a decision problem especially when there
 are many different factors are taken into account

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis, we will show to the readers how to incorporate Machine Learning
 in MCDA.
 Thus, to prove the feasibility of this incorporation; first, we will point
 out some difficulties which MCDA has when dealing with complicated decision
 problems, especially problems that repeat many times.
 Then we will see what advantages of Machine Learning can offer to solve
 these difficulties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The readers should notice that the structure of this thesis is not linear,
 readers should not only read from the beginning to the end of the paper.
 Instead, there will be many instructive lines of texts which can act as
 "signpost" or a guide of how to find the next information which can clarify
 the section that the readers are reading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make more sense to the readers, the contents of this thesis will be structure
d as follow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first chapter, readers will be greeted with basic concepts of MCDA
 and what we should expect from MCDA when using it to solve a decision problem.
 Also, we will see what kind of difficulties and associated decision problem
 in which Machine Learning is the solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next chapter, we will show the concept of Analytic Hierarchy Process
 (AHP) which is an MCDA method to derive priority or ratio scales from paired
 comparisons.
 Also, we will explain to the readers that why this method is a suitable
 example in proving that Machine Learning is the right solution for the
 problems mentioned in chapter one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the third chapter, we will focus on the detail of Machine Learning,
 especially Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro - Fuzzy Inference
 System (ANFIS).
 ANN and ANFIS are two methods of Machine Learning which are the potential
 candidates for incorporating with MCDA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, in the fourth chapter, we will design a system in which Machine Learning
 will play a major role in the MCDA process.
 With this system are two study cases which will show how effective Machine
 Learning can be in improving the decision making process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we will conclude the thesis with some conclusions which summarise
 the points of this thesis.
 Because the study for this thesis still in the early stage, we will also
 propose some suggestions for future improvements.

\begin_layout Section
Multi-criteria Decision Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin this chapter, we will examine the foundation theory of MCDA which
 is the Decision Theory in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Then we will also explain the reasons why people use MCDA for aiding the
 decision making process in

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After having a brief description of Decision Theory and MCDA, we will delve
 deep into the philosophy and paradigms of MCDA in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Basic-concept-mcda"

\end_inset

.
 In this section, we will explain the following notions: the general structure
 of an MCDA process, how to model a decision problem with MCDA, some notable
 features and finally some limitations of MCDA in some particular cases
 where Machine Learning will help overcome.
 We will also list some interest MCDA methods in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When readers have gained a considerable amount of knowledge about MCDA,
 we will show an example of a simple MCDA process to help readers to practice
 their new knowledge of MCDA in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:A-basic-example"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we will point out the reasons why we choose the AHP method as the
 candidate for our study for applying Machine Learning in MCDA in

The foundation of MCDA: Decision Theory
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decision Theory, in general, is simply a theory about making decisions.
 However, it is not an easy task to precisely define what Decision Theory
 is.
 It is because Decision Theory is truly an interdisciplinary subject which
 is pursued by researchers from many disciplines such as economists, statisticia
ns, psychologist, political and social scientists or philosophers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "wiki:decision_theory"

\end_inset

.
 Each discipline has its way of studying and theorising Decision Theory,
 for example, a psychologist might want to investigate the behaviour of
 people when they are making decisions, an economist is likely to study
 the payoffs of each decision or a political scientist will try to find
 the optimal voting rule by studying Decision Theory.
 However, if we abstract Decision Theory from all disciplines, we can see
 that Decision Theory is all about theorising human activities in situations
 where there are a goal and options to choose between in order to reach
 that goal, in other words, decision-making situations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can generalise the Decision Theory into two definitions: one is broad,
 and the other one is narrow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lectureUZ"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Broad definition
\series default
: Decision Theory is the set of all possible disciplines connected with
 making decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Narrow definition
\series default
: Decision Theory is the set of theoretical consideration of what is a decision,
 what is decision situation, what are elements of a decision situation,
 what is right or optimal decision and how to make a right or optimal decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also important to know that Decision Theory has two main branches:
 Normative Decision Theory and Descriptive Decision Theory.
 The brief definitions of those two branches can be given as follow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Normative Decision Theory
\series default
 concerns about constructing rules and methods of making decisions that
 in the context of an ideal decision maker (i.e.
 decision maker with perfect information) can identify the best decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Descriptive Decision Theory
\series default
 interests in the psychological or behavioural aspect of the decision maker
 (i.e.
 how do people in real situations make their decisions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, readers should notice the direction of the thesis in term of which
 branch of Decision Theory we will go from here.
 Because the goal of this study is to introduce a new approach, in this
 case, Machine Learning techniques, to enhance the process of making a decision;
 therefore, the majority of this study will be in the context of Normative
 Decision Theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Why-people-use"

\end_inset

, we will present to the readers the concept of Decision Analysis and why
 it is important to have Decision Analysis in every decision-making situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The necessary of Decision Analysis
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:The-foundation-of"

\end_inset

, we have known that in a decision-making situation, decision makers have
 the responsibility to choose the right option in order to realise the goal
 in that particular situation.
 However, there are many factors with hidden information in a decision-making
 situation that can hide the true value of each option thus affect the judgement
 of the decision maker.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, when choosing suppliers for providing materials to build a
 particular product.
 If we do not spend the time to research the past performance of each supplier,
 we will never know the true value of each supplier in term of providing
 the needed materials.
 Thus our judgment for choosing the suppliers will not be certain.
 To overcome this difficulty of uncertain judgment, a decision maker will
 need to practice Decision Analysis in a decision-making situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decision Analysis or Decision Aiding (DA) can be defined as follows 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

: It is the activity of using explicit and formalised models to help obtain
 elements of responses to the questions posed by a stakeholder in a decision
 process.
 In other words, it is the process of getting more information from the
 context of the decision-making situation to clarify the decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the above definition, DA's purpose 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

 is to establish the decision-making process with working hypotheses, formulatio
ns of propositions (satisfying solutions or possible compromises) which
 clears out the uncertainty in the decision maker's judgement.
 In such case, DA can contribute to the follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Analysing the context of the decision-making situation by various means
 such as identifying the actors, the possibilities of action, their consequences
, or the stakes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Organising and structuring how the decision-making process should proceed
 to improve the consistency among the values underlying the goal and the
 final decision that realise that goal.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:From-Monocriteria-to"

\end_inset

, we will present to readers the notions of Mono-criteria and Multi-criteria,
 thus the reason why MCDA is the prefer tool for many decision makers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
From Mono-criteria to Multi-criteria
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:From-Monocriteria-to"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a decision-making situation, a decision maker has two approaches to evaluate
 the options.
 They are Mono-criteria and Multi-criteria.
 To simply put, Mono-criteria is when the decision maker only uses one criterion
 for determining the value of each option of the decision problem.
 Multi-criteria, on the other hand, evaluate each option on many different
 criteria that associating with various aspects of the decision problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a decision maker is dealing with a DA process, it is very rare for
 the decision maker to have in mind only one single clear criterion (Mono-criter
ia).
 In a multi-actor environment, it is even more unlikely for that single
 criterion to satisfy the point of view of every actor in the decision-making
 process because each actor plays a different role in that process which
 gives different preference to the actor own objectives and value system
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For any case, it is essential to consider every point of view dealing with
 many perspectives of a decision-making situation, for example, the financial
 status, the current human resources, the affected ecosystem, security or
 quality of services.
 By regarding each related point of view individually, independently from
 the others, it is likely to arrive at a clear decision that meets all actors'
 preferences and requirements 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, it is typical to associating a particular criterion to each related
 point of view (Multi-criteria).
 For each associated criterion, it will be used to evaluate any potential
 action on an appropriate qualitative or quantitative scale 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we can see, in many decision-making contexts, using Mono-criteria approach
 might overlook certain aspects of the decision problem, thus affecting
 the judgement of the decision maker.
 Using Multi-criteria approach in such cases will help the decision maker
 to avoid the before-mentioned danger of neglecting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Basic-concept-mcda"

\end_inset

, we will explore the three basic concepts of MCDA which will give us a
 throughout view of the structure of a Decision Analysis process that connects
 with Multi-criteria to help the decision maker in solving his or her decision
 problem.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we will get into the details of Analytic Hierarchy Process
 (AHP) by answering questions such as: What is AHP? Who created it? Which
 kind of decision problem can we apply AHP?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After getting the general ideas about AHP, we will delve deep into the methodolo
gy and core elements of AHP such as: What is the Pair-wise comparison? How
 to make a Comparison Matrix? How to calculate priority vector? How to use
 Consistency Index and Consistency Ration to verify the comparisons?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Explaining AHP using only its definitions can be tough at some points.
 Therefore we will use an example to explain each aspect of AHP.
 It is easier to understand the concept of AHP that way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Brief Introduction of Analytic Hierarchy Process 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Brief-Introduction-of"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is created by Professor Thomas L.
 Saaty as a Multi-Criteria decision-making method.
 This method is described in the book ‚ÄúMathematical Principles of Decision
 Making‚Äù or ‚ÄúPrincipia Mathematica Decernendi‚Äù which Prof.
 Saaty wrote in the 70s 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "web:goepel_ahp"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, Analytic Hierarchy Process is a method to derive priority or
 ratio scales (we will use the word ‚Äúpriority‚Äù and ‚Äúratio‚Äù interchangeably)
 from paired comparisons 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "saaty2008decision"

\end_inset

.
 The input of AHP method is obtained from actual measurements such as price,
 weight, area, or from subjective opinion such as satisfaction feelings
 or preference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "teknomoAHPtutorial"

\end_inset

.
 To derive the ratio scales, we need to solve the principal Eigen Vectors
 problem and then to verify the scales we will use Consistency Index which
 is calculated from Eigenvalue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve a decision problem by using AHP, we need to decompose the decision
 problem into the following steps 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Saaty:1980ahp"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Define the problem and determine the kind of knowledge sought ‚Äì in other
 words, we set the goal of the decision problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Structure the hierarchy of the decision problem.
 The goal of the decision problem will be on the top level of the hierarchy.
 Then you will put the objectives or criteria (and sub-criteria) in the
 intermediate levels.
 Finally, at the lowest level will be the set of alternatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Construct a set of pairwise comparison matrices.
 In which, each element in an upper level is compared to the elements in
 the level immediately below to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calculate the priorities from the comparison matrices in each level of the
 hierarchy until the last priorities of the alternatives in the lowest level
 of our hierarchy are obtained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After obtaining priorities for the alternatives in the decision problem,
 we should calculate the Consistency Index and Consistency Ratio to see
 if our comparisons are logical and consistent.
 If not, we have to revise our comparisons to get a more consistent set
 of priorities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the priorities are consistent, we can use them to evaluate our alternatives
 and select the optimal alternative for our decision problem, i.e.
 the alternative with the highest priority.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because AHP allows small inconsistency in making comparison 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "teknomoAHPtutorial"

\end_inset

, we can use AHP to solve various decision problems, from making simple
 and straightforward decisions to complex and high-stakes problems in which
 human perceptions and judgements are required

One fascinating example of AHP application is suspect identification by
 witnesses in criminal cases 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "mu2013new"

\end_inset

.
 Usually, candidates for identification are shown altogether or sequential,
 but in the AHP case, they are shown in pairs.
 Comparisons between pairs are then made by the witnesses.
 Studies have shown that by using AHP method, the reliability of identification
 has been increased from 55% to 83% and the false identification rate has
 been reduced from 20% to 17% 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Also, the consistency index produced by AHP method is a good indicator
 for telling if the statements made by witnesses are consistent or not.

 In short, it is like asking between two objects, which one do you prefer
 and how much do you prefer it to the other object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we have two cars made by two different manufacturers, one is from

From

reference "tab:Number-of-comparisons"

\end_inset

, it suggests that if we compare too many objects (30 cars for example),
 the number of comparisons will become immensely significant (435 comparisons
 for 30 cars).
 With a large number of comparison, it will confuse the people who make
 the comparison, and as a result, the likelihood of inconsistent comparisons
 will be high.
 
\end_layout

Next, as we have made our pair-wise comparisons between objects, we will
 aggregate them into a Comparison Matrix.

In our example, we have a middle-aged man named Darek.
 Darek wants to buy a new car, but he does not know which car he should
 buy because there are just too many cars to choose.
 Thankfully, a friend who works in automobile industry recommends Darek
 three car models from three different manufacturers.
 These three cars are currently the best, but Darek can only choose one.
 Therefore he makes the comparisons in

Because we have three pair-wise comparisons, in this case, our comparison
 matrix will be a three by three matrix.
 In this matrix, the values on the diagonal line will be one because it
 is the value of a comparison of two same objects.
 We only have to fill up the upper triangular matrix, for the lower triangular
 matrix, we can use the reciprocal values of the upper triangular matrix.
 To fill up the comparison value, we use the following rules

In our case, because Darek strongly prefers Renault than Toyota, we put
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{5}$

 in row 1 and column 2 of the matrix.
 Next, Darek slightly prefers Ford than Toyota; we put 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

 in row 1 and column 3 of the matrix.
 Finally, between Renault and Ford, Darek very strongly prefers Renault
 then Ford, therefore we put 7 in row 2 and column 3 of the matrix.

Priority Vector
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the complete comparison matrix in the previous section, we can now
 find the priority vector for our alternatives.
 However, first, we need to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
 the matrix because the priority vector is the normalised principal Eigenvector
 of the matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix are calculated by using
 computer programs such as MATLAB or Maxima due to the increasing complexity
 in calculation when the size of the matrix is getting bigger.
 However, for small matrices with size 
\begin_inset Formula $n\leq3$
\end_inset

 like the one in our example, it is possible to use an approximation method
 to approximate the normalised principal Eigenvector with low error rate
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approximation method is very easy to use.
 All we need to do is just to normalise each column in the comparison matrix.
 For example, we got

\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

To get the approximation of the normalised principal Eigenvector we just
 need to average the matrix across the rows as follow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v=\frac{1}{3}\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{9}+\frac{7}{47}+\frac{1}{25}\\
\frac{5}{9}+\frac{35}{47}+\frac{21}{25}\\
\frac{1}{3}+\frac{5}{47}+\frac{3}{25}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0.1000\\
0.7134\\
0.1866
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we have got the priority vector or the approximation of the normalised
 principal Eigenvector of the comparison matrix.
 Since the sum of all elements in the priority vector is 1, it tells us
 the relative weights of all alternatives we have compared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By having the priority vector, we can say the weight or the priority of
 each car model in our example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Toyota car is 10%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Renault car is 71.34%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Ford car is 18.66%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to these weights, the Renault car has the highest priority (71.34%)
 among the three car models.
 Therefore, Darek can easily choose the Renault car as his new car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we need to verify if the comparisons made by Darek is consistent
 or not.
 To do this, we need to calculate the Principal Eigenvalue.
 It can be obtained in our approximation by the summation of products between
 each element of the priority vector and the sum of columns of the comparison
 matrix

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{max}=9*(0.1)+\frac{47}{35}*(0.7134)+\frac{25}{3}*(0.1866)=3.4129
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using this Principal Eigenvalue, we can verify the consistency of our pair-wise
 comparisons by calculating the Consistency Index and Consistency Ratio
 which will be shown in the next section.

\begin_layout Standard
The consistency of pair-wise comparison is closely related to the transitive
 property 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "teknomoAHPtutorial"

\end_inset

.
 Which means for a person who prefers A than B or 
\begin_inset Formula $A\succ B$
\end_inset

 and he also prefers B than C or 
\begin_inset Formula $B\succ C$
\end_inset

 then according to transitive property, this person should prefer A than
 C or 
\begin_inset Formula $A\succ C$
\end_inset

.
 If for any reason, this particular person does not prefer A than C, but
 he prefers C than A or 
\begin_inset Formula $C\succ A$
\end_inset

, then we can say that his comparisons over A, B, and C are inconsistent
 with each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let‚Äôs check this consistency in our example in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 Based on the three comparisons in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Darek's-pair-wise-comparisons"

\end_inset

, we can see that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Darek prefers the Renault car more than the Ford car or ùëÖùëíùëõùëéùë¢ùëôùë° ‚âª ùêπùëúùëüùëë.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Darek prefers the Ford car more than the Toyota car or ùêπùëúùëüùëë ‚âª ùëáùëúùë¶ùëúùë°ùëé.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, the comparisons made by Darek appear to be consistent:
