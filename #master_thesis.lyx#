Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) which also can be call as "Multiple
 Criteria Decision-Making" or "Multi-criteria Decision Aiding'' in English
 or "Analyse Multicritère" in French is an exciting field which has seen
 many achievements including increasing number of research papers, books,
 and theoretical over the years since the 60s

\begin_layout Standard
For many decision makers, MCDA is an excellent tool in getting comprehensive
 insight information when solving a decision problem especially when there
 are many different factors are taken into account

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis, we will show to the readers how to incorporate Machine Learning
 in MCDA.
 Thus, to prove the feasibility of this incorporation; first, we will point
 out some difficulties which MCDA has when dealing with complicated decision
 problems, especially problems that repeat many times.
 Then we will see what advantages of Machine Learning can offer to solve
 these difficulties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make more sense to the readers, the contents of this thesis will be structure
d as follow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Multi-criteria-Decision-Analysis"

\end_inset

, readers will be greeted with basic concepts of MCDA and what we should
 expect from MCDA when using it to solve a decision problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:The-Method-of"

\end_inset

, we will show the concept of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) which is
 an MCDA method to derive priority or ratio scales from paired comparisons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Soft-Computing-with"

\end_inset

, we will focus on the detail of Machine Learning, especially Artificial
 Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro - Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS).
 ANN and ANFIS are two methods of Machine Learning which are the potential
 candidates for incorporating with MCDA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Case-Studies"

\end_inset

, we will design a system in which Machine Learning will play a major role
 in the MCDA process.
 With this system are two study cases which will show how effective Machine
 Learning can be in improving the decision making process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we will conclude the thesis with some conclusions which summarise
 the points of this thesis.
 Because the study for this thesis still in the early stage, we will also
 propose some suggestions for future improvements.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decision Theory, in general, is simply a theory about making decisions.
 However, it is not an easy task to precisely define what Decision Theory
 is.
 It is because Decision Theory is truly an interdisciplinary subject which
 is pursued by researchers from many disciplines such as economists, statisticia
ns, psychologist, political and social scientists or philosophers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "wiki:decision_theory"

\end_inset

.
 Each discipline has its way of studying and theorising Decision Theory,
 for example, a psychologist might want to investigate the behaviour of
 people when they are making decisions, an economist is likely to study
 the payoffs of each decision or a political scientist will try to find
 the optimal voting rule by studying Decision Theory.
 However, if we abstract Decision Theory from all disciplines, we can see
 that Decision Theory is all about theorising human activities in situations
 where there are a goal and options to choose between in order to reach
 that goal, in other words, decision-making process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can generalise the Decision Theory into two definitions: one is broad,
 and the other one is narrow

 making decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling

Narrow definition
\series default
: Decision Theory is the set of theoretical consideration of what is a decision,
 what is decision situation, what are elements of a decision situation,
 what is right or optimal decision and how to make a right or optimal decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also important to know that Decision Theory has two main branches:
 Normative Decision Theory and Descriptive Decision Theory.
 The brief definitions of those two branches can be given as follow:

\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

 concerns about constructing rules and methods of making decisions that
 in the context of an ideal decision maker (i.e.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, readers should notice the direction of the thesis in term of which
 branch of Decision Theory we will go from here.
 Because the goal of this study is to introduce a new approach, in this
 case, Machine Learning techniques, to enhance the process of making a decision;
 therefore, the majority of this study will be in the context of Normative
 Decision Theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for the consequences of their decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\series bold
Goal
\series default
: The desired state of our decision problem, usually it is what we want
 to achieve after solving the decision problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling

\series bold
Initial

 state: The beginning state of our decision problem i.e.
 all the measurements, parameters, conditions or factors we have before
 starting the decision-making process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\series bold
Decisions
\series default
: The options or alternative courses of action which are the possibilities
 of realising our goal or desired state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\series bold
Criterion
\series default
: A measurement or a standard which allows comparing between different options
 or alternatives.
 The criterion can be profit, cost, time, effort, property, measurable index,
 measurable attribute or measurable characteristic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\series bold
Constraints
\series default
: Limitations stated by the decision problem.
 It can also be used to decide the polarity of a criterion, i.e.
 to decide if a criterion is a positive criterion or negative criterion.
 For example, if a decision problem has time constraint then evaluation
 from criteria related to time such as time to manufacture, time to delivery,
 response time or time to travel should be as small as possible.
 In other words, those criteria are negative criteria, i.e.
 the smaller the value, the better the evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\series bold
Consequences
\series default
: Outcomes or results we get after realising the goal with the option or
 alternative we have chosen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\series bold
Uncertainty
\series default
: The set of all consequences that are outside the set of expected consequences
 of the goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\series bold
Preferences
\series default
: The view of each decision maker which determines the importance of each
 criterion.
 For example, in a decision problem where the time and cost are criteria,
 a decision maker may think time is the most important criterion while the
 other decision maker may think the opposite, cost is the most important
 criterion.
 Therefore, an alternative with high evaluation from time criterion may
 be appealing to decision makers who value time criterion while at the same
 time being ignored by decision makers who value cost criterion.
 This element is the most important one in a decision situation because
 it directly affects the performance of an alternative in different decision
 maker view.

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Components-of-a"

\end_inset

, all the elements of decision-making process are drawn as members of an
 analysis process.
 As we can see, the process starts first by formulating the Initial State
 of the decision problem, so then we can find the Constraints of the decision
 problem, determine the Criteria and construct the Alternatives.
 Then this information is given to Decision Makers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After formulating the information from the Initial State, each Decision
 Maker with his or her Preferences takes part in an Evaluating Process along
 with the given Alternatives, Criteria and Constraints.
 During the Evaluating Process, one alternative or combination of alternatives
 which is considered the best comparing to other alternatives is chosen
 to realise the goal of the decision situation.
 Finally, after realising the goal using the selected alternative, we get
 the outcomes from the realisation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These outcomes belong to the Uncertainty set because no matter how careful
 the Evaluating Process is executed by Decision Makers, there are always
 some uncontrollable and unforeseeable factors that could affect the outcomes.
 In other words, we can make a good decision by thorough deliberation in
 the process of Evaluating Process and take into account all possible informatio
n from Initial State, but because of the Uncertainty, we cannot know for
 sure if that decision is the right decision or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 it is important to have Decision Analysis in every decision-making process.

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:The-process-of"

\end_inset

, we have known that in a decision-making process, decision makers have
 the responsibility to choose the right decision in order to realise the
 goal in that particular situation.
 However, there are many factors with hidden information in a decision-making
 process that can hide the true value of each decision thus affect the judgement
 of the decision maker.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, when choosing suppliers for providing materials to build a
 particular product.
 If we do not spend the time to research the past performance of each supplier,
 we will never know the true value of each supplier in term of providing
 the needed materials.
 Thus our judgment for choosing the suppliers will not be certain.
 To overcome this difficulty of uncertain judgment, a decision maker will
 need to practice Decision Analysis in a decision-making process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decision Analysis or Decision Aiding (DA) can be defined as follows 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

: It is the activity of using explicit and formalised models to help obtain
 elements of responses to the questions posed by a stakeholder in a decision
 process.
 In other words, it is the process of getting more information from the
 context of the decision-making process to clarify various components inside
 a decision problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the above definition, DA's purpose is to establish the decision-making
 process with working hypotheses, formulations of propositions (satisfying
 solutions or possible compromises) which clears out the uncertainty in
 the decision maker's judgement 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

 .
 In such case, DA can contribute to the follows:

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:From-Monocriteria-to"

\end_inset

, we will present to readers the notions of Mono-criteria and Multi-criteria,
 thus the reason why MCDA is the prefer tool for many decision makers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
From Mono-criteria to Multi-criteria
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:From-Monocriteria-to"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a decision-making process, a decision maker has two approaches to evaluate
 the options.
 They are Mono-criteria and Multi-criteria.
 To simply put, Mono-criteria is when the decision maker only uses one criterion
 for determining the value of each option of the decision problem.
 Multi-criteria, on the other hand, evaluate each option on many different
 criteria that associating with various aspects of the decision problem.
 Readers can find more information about criterion in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Basic-concept-mcda"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a decision maker is dealing with a DA process, it is very rare for
 the decision maker to have in mind only one single clear criterion (Mono-criter
ia).
 In a multi-actor environment, it is even more unlikely for that single
 criterion to satisfy the point of view of every actor in the decision-making
 process because each actor plays a different role in that process which
 gives different preference to the actor own objectives and value system
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For any case, it is essential to consider every point of view dealing with
 many perspectives of a decision-making process, for example, the financial
 status, the current human resources, the affected ecosystem, security or
 quality of services.
 By regarding each related point of view individually, independently from
 the others, it is likely to arrive at a clear decision that meets all actors'
 preferences and requirements 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, it is typical to associating a particular criterion to each related
 point of view (Multi-criteria).
 For each associated criterion, it will be used to evaluate any potential
 action on an appropriate qualitative or quantitative scale 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we can see, in many decision-making contexts, using Mono-criteria approach
 might overlook certain aspects of the decision problem, thus affecting
 the judgement of the decision maker.
 Using Multi-criteria approach in such cases will help the decision maker
 to avoid the before-mentioned danger of neglecting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 throughout view of the structure of a Decision Analysis process that connects
 with Multi-criteria to help the decision maker in solving his or her decision
 problem.

\begin_layout Standard
In a decision-making process, to make a decision, the decision maker have
 to choose an action with the purpose of realising the goal of the decision
 problem by using the chosen action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The action in this sense can be defined as a potential action which constitutes
 to the object of the decision or one of the objectives of the decision
 analysis process.
 However, not all action can be qualified as a potential action.
 The action must be considered to be possible to implement it or justifies
 some interests within the decision analysis process

\begin_layout Description

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many authors believed that potential actions should be mutual exclusive,
 but it is not always the case 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

.
 In many real world decision analysis contexts, it is appropriate to combine
 several potential actions into realising the goal of the decision problem
 rather than using only one potential action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, for any decision analysis process, there is always a set of
 more than two potential actions or alternatives, and this set is not fixed
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "roy2005paradigms"

\end_inset

.
 During the decision analysis process, this set can evolve i.e.
 adding more potential actions as a result of investigating every aspect
 of the decision problem.
 For example, the investigation can help gain more knowledge about the goal,
 constraints, the preferences of the stakeholders, the possible outcomes
 of the actions, and other aspects of the decision problem.
 Thus, this new knowledge could open new boundary that helps to identify
 other actions as potential action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the set of all potential actions or alternatives in a decision-making
 process, we will use 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to denote it.
 To designate a potential action or alternative, we use 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 When the number of actions is finite 
\begin_inset Formula $(|A|=m)$
\end_inset

 we have:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\{a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{m}\}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard

The readers should recall from

 that a criterion is used as a tool to determine the value of an alternative.
 By using the notion of potential action 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Alternatives"

\end_inset

, we can denote a criterion as a function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 which evaluates a potential action or alternative; this function then outputs
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $performance$
\end_inset

 value associating with the input potential action.
 We will denote this evaluation as 
\begin_inset Formula $g(a)$

 This set

 we find the set of alternatives which satisfies it.
 After getting all the sets of satisfying alternatives for each criterion,

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

Disjunctive Method

 In other words, instead of intersecting all the sets of satisfying alternatives
 for each criterion, we find the union of all those sets.

 Criteria to have weights:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\series bold
Lexicographic Method
\series default
: We will order the criteria from the most important to the less important.
 The ordering will be based on the weights of the criteria.
 Then, we will choose alternatives which are the best with respect to the
 first ranking criterion base on the evaluation of the Decision Table.
 If there is only one such alternative, then we will stop the process.
 If there are more such alternatives (more than two), we will continue to
 choose from these alternatives the ones which are the best with respect
 to the second ranking criterion.
 We will continue the process unless we reach the last criterion in the
 ordering or there is only one alternative left.

\begin_layout Labeling

Weighted Average Method

 By comparing the scores and select the biggest one, we will have our best
 alternative.

In this section, we will get into the details of Analytic Hierarchy Process
 (AHP) by answering questions such as: What is AHP? Who created it? Which
 kind of decision problem can we apply AHP?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After getting the general ideas about AHP, we will delve deep into the methodolo
gy and core elements of AHP such as: What is the Pair-wise comparison? How
 to make a Comparison Matrix? How to calculate priority vector? How to use
 Consistency Index and Consistency Ration to verify the comparisons?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Explaining AHP using only its definitions can be tough at some points.
 Therefore we will use an example to explain each aspect of AHP.
 It is easier to understand the concept of AHP that way.

Brief History of Analytic Hierarchy Process 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is created by Professor Thomas L.
 Saaty as a Multi-Criteria decision-making method.
 This method is described in the book “Mathematical Principles of Decision
 Making” or “Principia Mathematica Decernendi” which Prof.
 Saaty wrote in the 70s 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, Analytic Hierarchy Process is a method to derive priority or
 ratio scales (we will use the word “priority” and “ratio” interchangeably)
 from paired comparisons 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "saaty2008decision"

\end_inset

.
 The input of AHP method is obtained from actual measurements such as price,
 weight, area, or from subjective opinion such as satisfaction feelings
 or preference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "teknomoAHPtutorial"

\end_inset

.
 To derive the ratio scales, we need to solve the principal Eigenvectors
 problem and then to verify the scales we will use Consistency Index which
 is calculated from Eigenvalue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve a decision problem by using AHP, we need to decompose the decision
 problem into the following steps

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Define the problem and determine the kind of knowledge sought – in other
 words, we set the goal of the decision problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Structure the hierarchy of the decision problem.
 The goal of the decision problem will be on the top level of the hierarchy.
 Then you will put the objectives or criteria (and sub-criteria) in the
 intermediate levels.
 Finally, at the lowest level will be the set of alternatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Construct a set of pairwise comparison matrices.
 In which, each element in an upper level is compared to the elements in
 the level immediately below to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calculate the priorities from the comparison matrices in each level of the
 hierarchy until the last priorities of the alternatives in the lowest level
 of our hierarchy are obtained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After obtaining priorities for the alternatives in the decision problem,
 we should calculate the Consistency Index and Consistency Ratio to see
 if our comparisons are logical and consistent.
 If not, we have to revise our comparisons to get a more consistent set
 of priorities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the priorities are consistent, we can use them to evaluate our alternatives
 and select the optimal alternative for our decision problem, i.e.
 the alternative with the highest priority.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because AHP allows small inconsistency in making comparison 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, we can use AHP to solve various decision problems, from making simple
 and straightforward decisions to complex and high-stakes problems in which
 human perceptions and judgements are required

One fascinating example of AHP application is suspect identification by
 witnesses in criminal cases 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "mu2013new"

\end_inset

.
 Usually, candidates for identification are shown altogether or sequential,
 but in the AHP case, they are shown in pairs.
 Comparisons between pairs are then made by the witnesses.
 Studies have shown that by using AHP method, the reliability of identification
 has been increased from 55% to 83% and the false identification rate has
 been reduced from 20% to 17% 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Also, the consistency index produced by AHP method is a good indicator
 for telling if the statements made by witnesses are consistent or not.

reference "tab:Number-of-comparisons"

\end_inset

, it suggests that if we compare too many objects (30 cars for example),
 the number of comparisons will become immensely significant (435 comparisons
 for 30 cars).
 With a large number of comparison, it will confuse the people who make
 the comparison, and as a result, the likelihood of inconsistent comparisons
 will be high.

Next in

We will use the comparison between three cars in the previous section as
 the example of how to make a comparison matrix from pair-wise comparisons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our example, we have a middle-aged man named Darek.
 Darek wants to buy a new car, but he does not know which car he should
 buy because there are just too many cars to choose.
 Thankfully, a friend who works in automobile industry recommends Darek
 three car models from three different manufacturers.
 These three cars are currently the best, but Darek can only choose one.
 Therefore he makes the comparisons in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 based on his subjective judgement.

Because we have three pair-wise comparisons, in this case, our comparison
 matrix will be a three by three matrix.
 In this matrix, the values on the diagonal line will be one because it
 is the value of a comparison of two same objects.
 We only have to fill up the upper triangular matrix, for the lower triangular
 matrix, we can use the reciprocal values of the upper triangular matrix.
 To fill up the comparison value, we use the following rules

In our case, because Darek strongly prefers Renault than Toyota, we put

 in row 1 and column 2 of the matrix.
 Next, Darek slightly prefers Ford than Toyota; we put 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

 in row 1 and column 3 of the matrix.
 Finally, between Renault and Ford, Darek very strongly prefers Renault
 then Ford, therefore we put 7 in row 2 and column 3 of the matrix.

With the complete comparison matrix in the previous section, we can now

 However, first, we need to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
 the matrix because the priority vector is the normalised principal Eigenvector
 of the matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix are calculated by using
 computer programs such as MATLAB or Maxima due to the increasing complexity
 in calculation when the size of the matrix is getting bigger.
 However, for small matrices with size 
\begin_inset Formula $n\leq3$

 like the one in our example, it is possible to use an approximation method
 to approximate the normalised principal Eigenvector with low error rate

To get the approximation of the normalised principal Eigenvector we just
 need to average the matrix across the rows as follow:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v=\frac{1}{3}\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{9}+\frac{7}{47}+\frac{1}{25}\\
\frac{5}{9}+\frac{35}{47}+\frac{21}{25}\\
\frac{1}{3}+\frac{5}{47}+\frac{3}{25}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0.1000\\
0.7134\\
0.1866
\end{bmatrix}\label{eq:eigenv}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we have got the priority vector or the approximation of the normalised
 principal Eigenvector of the comparison matrix.
 Since the sum of all elements in the priority vector is 1, it tells us
 the relative weights of all alternatives we have compared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By having the priority vector, we can say the weight or the priority of
 each car model in our example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Toyota car is 10%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Ford car is 18.66%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to these weights, the Renault car has the highest priority (71.34%)
 among the three car models.
 Therefore, Darek can easily choose the Renault car as his new car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, we need to verify if the comparisons made by Darek is consistent
 or not.
 To do this, we need to calculate the Principal Eigenvalue.
 It can be obtained in our approximation by the summation of products between
 each element of the priority vector and the sum of columns of the comparison
 matrix 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{max}=9*(0.1)+\frac{47}{35}*(0.7134)+\frac{25}{3}*(0.1866)=3.4129\label{eq:eigen}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using this Principal Eigenvalue, we can verify the consistency of our pair-wise
 comparisons by calculating the Consistency Index and Consistency Ratio
 which will be shown in

\begin_layout Standard
The consistency of pair-wise comparison is closely related to the transitive
 property 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "teknomoAHPtutorial"

\end_inset

.
 Which means for a person who prefers A than B or 
\begin_inset Formula $A\succ B$
\end_inset

 and he also prefers B than C or 
\begin_inset Formula $B\succ C$
\end_inset

 then according to transitive property, this person should prefer A than
 C or 
\begin_inset Formula $A\succ C$
\end_inset

.
 If for any reason, this particular person does not prefer A than C, but
 he prefers C than A or 
\begin_inset Formula $C\succ A$
\end_inset

, then we can say that his comparisons over A, B, and C are inconsistent
 with each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let’s check this consistency in our example in
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Comparison-Matrix"

\end_inset

.
 Based on the three comparisons in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Darek's-pair-wise-comparisons"

\end_inset

, we can see that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Darek prefers the Renault car more than the Ford car or 
\begin_inset Formula $Renault\succ Ford$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Darek prefers the Ford car more than the Toyota car or 
\begin_inset Formula $Ford\succ Toyota$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Darek prefers the Renault car more than the Toyota car or 
\begin_inset Formula $Renault\succ Toyota$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, the comparisons made by Darek appear to be consistent: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Renault\succ Ford\land Ford\succ Toyota\Longrightarrow Renault\succ Toyota\label{eq:transitivity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
(satisfies the transitive property)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If Darek had made the last comparison as follow: 
\begin_inset Formula $Toyota\succ Renault$
\end_inset

, then this comparison will be inconsistent with other comparisons thus
 making Darek judgement in choosing new car inconsistent and not reliable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there is a problem with this check.
 This check does not take into account of how much Darek prefer each car.
 Therefore, we cannot know if the values in the comparison matrix are consistent
 with each other or not.
 This fact can make the whole hierarchy of AHP (especially multi-level hierarchy
) becomes inconsistent because we have to make a pair-wise comparison in
 each level of the hierarchy and the immediately lower level will use the
 priority vector produced by pair-wise comparison of the base level to calculate
 its global weights

 Eigenvalue should be equal to the size of the comparison matrix, or

.
 Then, to know how many degrees of consistent a comparison matrix is, Prof.
 Saaty gave us a measurement of consistency, the Consistency Index or CI.
 To calculate this index, we use the following formula:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
CI=\frac{\lambda_{max}-n}{n-1}\label{eq:cii}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, applying into our example which has 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{max}=3.4129$
\end_inset

 and the size of the comparison matrix is 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

; we have the consistency index as follow: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
CI=\frac{\lambda_{max}-n}{n-1}=\frac{3.4129-3}{2}=0.20645\label{eq:ci}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, how can we use this index to determine the consistency of our comparison?
 Once again, according to Prof.
 Saaty, by comparing it with the appropriate one we can know how many degrees
 of consistent our comparison matrix is.
 The proper consistency index is called Random Consistency Index or RI

To compare the Consistency Index with the corresponding Random Consistency

 Saaty proposed the Consistency Ratio which is calculated using the following
 formula

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
CR=\frac{CI}{RI}\label{eq:crr}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the value of Consistency Ratio is smaller or equal to 10%, then the inconsist
ency in the comparison matrix is acceptable.
 However, if the Consistency Ratio is greater than 10%, we need to revise
 our judgement in the pair-wise comparison process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our example, we have: 
\begin_inset Formula $CI=0.20645$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $RI$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.58$
\end_inset

, then we have the Consistency Ratio as follow: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
CR=\frac{CI}{RI}=\frac{0.20645}{0.58}=0.3559\label{eq:cr}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have 
\begin_inset Formula $CR=35\%>10\%$

 Therefore we can see that Darek’s subjective judgement in the pair-wise
 comparison process is not consistent.
 Thus, we recommend a revision for Darek’s pair-wise comparison between
 three car models to improve the consistency.

When using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, especially AHP method, to deal
 with decision problems of high complexity (i.e.
 decision problems with many variables, criteria, or alternatives) the cost
 of computation to find the exact solution could increase exponentially.
 Also, it is impossible to account all uncertainty elements of the problems
 too, thus reducing the effectiveness of the solution.
 However, there is an interesting alternative way to find the approximate
 solution for these particular decision problems without having high computation
 cost; it is by using Soft Computing.

In a sense, artificial neural network (ANN) simulate the architecture of
 the human brain.
 It is a type of network that sees nodes as artificial neurons.
 This network of artificial neurons is a computational model inspired by
 natural neurons.
 Natural neurons receive signals through synapses located on the dendrites
 or membrane of the neuron.
 When the input signal received by the neuron are strong enough (i.e.
 it surpasses a certain threshold), the neuron is activated and emits an
 output signal through the axon.
 This signal might be sent to another synapse, and might active other neurons
 in the network

Because the human brain contains billions of neurons and connections, therefore
 the complexity of real neurons is highly abstracted when modelling artificial
 neurons.
 In fact, the basic model of artificial neuron just consists of inputs (represen
ts synapses), which are multiplied by weights (represents the strength of
 the respective signals), and then computed by a mathematical function which
 determines the activation of the neuron.
 Another function computes the output of the artificial neuron.
 Finally, ANN combines these artificial neurons into the network to process
 information

To understand the learning process of ANN, we will have to examine the very
 basic element of the neural network, that is the artificial neuron.
 An artificial neuron has five main elements: inputs, weights, sum function,
 activation function and outputs.
 Inputs are information that enters the neuron from other neurons or the
 external world.
 Weights are values that express the effect of an input set or another processin
g element in the previous layer on this process element.
 Sum function is a function that calculates the effect of inputs and weights
 totally on this process element.
 This function calculates the net input that comes to a neuron.
 The activation function or as call as transfer function take the outcome
 from the sum function and then calculates the output of the neuron

\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$

 The values 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1j},w_{2j},...$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{nj}$
\end_inset

 are weight factors associated with each input to the node.
 The weights determine the intensity of the input signal.
 Every input (
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}$
\end_inset

) is multiplied by its corresponding weight factor (
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1j},w_{2j},...,w_{nj}$
\end_inset

) , and the node uses this weighted input (
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1j}a_{1},w_{2j}a_{2},...,w_{nj}a_{n}$
\end_inset

) to perform further calculations.
 If the weight factor is positive, the weighted input (
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ij}a_{i}$
\end_inset

) tends to excite the node.
 If the weight factor is negative, the weighted input (
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ij}a_{i}$
\end_inset

) inhibits the node.
 In the initial setup of an artificial neural network, weight factors may
 be chosen randomly according to a specified statistical distribution.
 Then, these weight factors are adjusted in the development of the network

 If

 node-firing.
 If

 node-firing.
 If no internal threshold is specified, a zero value is assumed.

After the training is completed, the network error is usually minimised,
 and the network output shows reasonable similarities with the target output,
 and before a neural network can be used with any degree of confidence,
 there is a need to establish the validity of the results it generates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A network could provide almost perfect answers to the set of problems with
 which it was trained, but fail to produce meaningful answers to other examples.
 Usually, validation involves evaluating network performance on a set of
 test particular that were not used for training.
 Generalisation (testing) is so named because it measures how well the network
 can generalise what it has learned and form rules with which to make decisions
 about data it has not previously seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The error between the actual and predicted outputs of testing and training
 converges upon the same point corresponding to the best set of weight factors
 for the network.
 If the network is learning an accurate generalised solution to the problem,
 the average error curve for the test patterns decreases at a rate approaching
 that of the training patterns.
 Generalisation capability can be used to evaluate the behaviour of the
 neural network.

ifferences in the magnitude of variables by adjusting the network weights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid such problems, normalisation all input and output variables is
 recommended.
 The training patterns should be normalised before they are applied to the
 neural network.
 Besides, the activation function used in the back-propagation neural network
 is a sigmoid function or hyperbolic tangent function.
 The lower and upper limits of the function are 0 and 1 respectively for
 sigmoid function and are -1 and +1 for hyperbolic tangent function.

 provides a mathematical framework to deal with vagueness associated with
 the description of a variable.
 The commonly used fuzzy inference system (FIS) is the actual process of
 mapping from a given input to output using fuzzy logic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuzzy logic is particularly useful in the development of expert systems.
 Expert systems are built by capturing the knowledge of humans: however,
 such knowledge is known to be qualitative and inexact.
 Experts may be only partially knowledgeable about the problem domain, or
 data may not be fully available, but decisions are still expected.
 In these situations, educated guesses need to be made to provide solutions
 to problems.
 This is where fuzzy logic can be employed as a tool to deal with imprecision
 and qualitative aspects that are associated with problem-solving

\begin_layout Standard
A fuzzy set is a set without clear or sharp boundaries or without binary
 membership characteristics.
 Unlike a conventional set where object either belongs or do not belong
 to the set, partial membership in a fuzzy set is possible.
 In other words, there is a softness associated with the membership of elements
 in a fuzzy set 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jang1993anfis"

\end_inset

.
 A fuzzy set may be represented by a membership function.
 This function gives the grade (degree) of membership within the set.
 The membership function maps the elements of the universe onto numerical
 values in the interval.
 The membership functions most commonly used in control theory are triangular,
 trapezoidal, Gaussian, generalised bell, sigmoidal and difference sigmoidal
 membership functions

As mentioned previously, the fuzzy inference system is the process of formulatin
g the mapping from a given input to an output using fuzzy logic.
 The dynamic behaviour of a FIS is characterised by a set of linguistic
 description rules based on expert knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fuzzy system and neural networks are complementary technologies.
 The primary reason for combining fuzzy systems with neural networks is
 to use the learning capability of the neural network.
 While the learning capability is an advantage from the viewpoint of a fuzzy
 system, from the viewpoint of a neural network there are additional advantages
 to a combined system.
 Because a neuro-fuzzy system is based on linguistic rules, we can easily
 integrate prior knowledge into the system, and this can substantially shorten
 the learning process.
 One of the popular integrated systems is an ANFIS, which is an integration
 of a fuzzy inference system with a back-propagation algorithm

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "mamdani1975experiment,sugeno1985industrial"

\end_inset

.
 Because the Sugeno system is more compact and computationally more efficient
 than a Mamdani system, it lends itself to the user of adaptive techniques
 for constructing the fuzzy models.
 These adaptive techniques can be used to customise the membership functions
 so that the fuzzy system best models the data.
 The fuzzy inference system based on neuro-adaptive learning techniques
 is termed adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system

\begin_layout Standard
For an FIS to be mature and well established so that it can work appropriately
 in prediction mode, its initial structure and parameters (linear and non-linear
) need to be tuned or adapted through a learning process using a sufficient
 input-output pattern of data.
 One of the most commonly used learning systems for adapting the linear
 and non-linear parameters of an FIS, particularly the first order Sugeno
 fuzzy model, is the ANFIS.
 ANFIS is a class of adaptive networks that are functionally equivalent
 to fuzzy inference systems
