INTRODUCTION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) which also can be call as "Multiple
 Criteria Decision-Making" or "Multicriteria Decision Aiding'' in English
 or "Analyse Multicrit√®re" in French is an exciting field which has seen
 many achievements including increasing number of research papers, books,
 and theoretical over the years since the 60s

For many decision makers, MCDA is an excellent tool in getting comprehensive
 insight information when solving a decision problem especially when there
 are many different factors are taken into account

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis, we will show to the readers how to incorporate Machine Learning
 in MCDA.
 Thus, to prove the feasibility of this incorporation; first, we will point
 out some difficulties which MCDA has when dealing with complicated decision
 problems, especially problems that repeat many times.
 Then we will see what advantages of Machine Learning can offer to solve
 these difficulties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The readers should notice that the structure of this thesis is not linear,
 readers should not only read from the beginning to the end of the paper.
 Instead, there will be many instructive lines of texts which can act as
 "signpost" or a guide of how to find the next information which can clarify
 the section that the readers are reading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make more sense to the readers, the contents of this thesis will be structure
d as follow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first chapter, readers will be greeted with basic concepts of MCDA
 and what we should expect from MCDA when using it to solve a decision problem.
 Also, we will see what kind of difficulties and associated decision problem
 in which Machine Learning is the solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next chapter, we will show the concept of Analytic Hierarchy Process
 (AHP) which is an MCDA method to derive priority or ratio scales from paired
 comparisons.
 Also, we will explain to the readers that why this method is a suitable
 example in proving that Machine Learning is the right solution for the
 problems mentioned in chapter one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the third chapter, we will focus on the detail of Machine Learning,
 especially Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro - Fuzzy Inference
 System (ANFIS).
 ANN and ANFIS are two methods of Machine Learning which are the potential
 candidates for incorporating with MCDA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, in the fourth chapter, we will design a system in which Machine Learning
 will play a major role in the MCDA process.
 With this system are two study cases which will show how effective Machine
 Learning can be in improving the decision making process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we will conclude the thesis with some conclusions which summarise
 the points of this thesis.
 Because the study for this thesis still in the early stage, we will also
 propose some suggestions for future improvements.
